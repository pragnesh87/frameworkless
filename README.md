# Frameworkless / Microservice:

## How Run Application

`clone REPO`

`php -S localhost:8000 -t public`

---

## HTTP Request and Response:

    For HTTP Request and Response we need PSR-7 compliant package.
    - laminas/laminas-diactoros
    - nyholm/psr7 & nyholm/psr7-server

    We need PSR-15 compliant package to handle request and emit response.
    - laminas/laminas-httphandlerrunner
    - middlewares/request-handler

## Router:

    There are several package available for router.
    - nikic/fast-route
    - league/route
    - middlewares/fast-route

## Container:

    PSR-11 Container
    - php-di/php-di
    - league/container

## Authentication:

    Unless our web service will be used exclusively in a private network, then authentication is essential. PSR-15 compliant auth middleware can be found in middlewares/psr15-middlewares, which can be integrated in only a few steps. For our purposes, simple basic authentication is enough, but other concepts, like JWT Tokens, can also be implemented in the same way.

## Database:

    For our example, we are using a classic MySQL database. doctrine/dbal provides a simple, yet powerful abstraction layer. Of course, using another database, such as MongoDB, is also possible. PHP packages exist for every established database, but a PSR for databases does not exist (yet?).

## Logging:

    The PSR-3-compliant package monolog/monolog is almost a standard in its own right. Itâ€™s worthwhile to rely on monolog from the start because from logging, to local files, to cloud storage, an adapter is available for every case and is configured with just a few lines of code.

## Tests:

    phpunit/phpunit is a solid choice for Unit Tests. But you can also use other testing tools like Atoum, Codeception, or phpSpec.
